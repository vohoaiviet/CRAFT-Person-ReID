## How to use

"demo.m" is the entrance script. Please run it with matlab to see the pipeline of our system. You can use "matlabpool" for parallel computing.

"cameraCorrelation.m" estimates the camera correlation. "CRAFT.m" transforms the original feature by CRAFT. These two functions are the main contribution of our system.
